# This file makes the 'app' directory a Python package.
# It can also be used for app-wide initializations if necessary.

# For example, you might want to expose the main FastAPI app instance here,
# though it's commonly defined and managed in main.py.

# from .main import app # If main.py was inside app, which it is not in this structure.

# Expose key components if desired for easier imports elsewhere, though often not needed.
# from .core.config import settings
# from .api.v1.api import api_router
